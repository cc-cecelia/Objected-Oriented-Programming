# Object-Oriented Programming Project

This repository contains a series of individual tasks developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course with more than 16000+ lines of java code in total.
Each task is divided into multiple units, with three iterations for each unit. The project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Project Breakdown

### Unit 1: Polynomial Calculator
- A program that implements a polynomial calculator, allowing users to perform operations on polynomials.
- The task includes building classes to represent polynomials and perform various mathematical operations.

### Unit 2: Multi-threaded Elevator Scheduling Simulator
- A simulation that models an elevator system, scheduling multiple elevators and managing their tasks concurrently using multi-threading.
- The goal is to design a system that efficiently handles elevator requests, optimizing the scheduling process.

### Unit 3: Social Network Simulator
- A simulation of a social network, focusing on user interactions and connections.
- This task involves the creation of classes representing users, posts, comments, and other social media-related entities.

### Unit 4: School Library Management System Simulator
- A simulation of a library management system for a school, which includes managing books, users, and library transactions.
- This unit focuses on object-oriented principles for managing and organizing large sets of data.

## Development Environment

All tasks in this project were developed using **IntelliJ IDEA**, a powerful IDE for Java development. The project is designed to practice and demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and multi-threading.
